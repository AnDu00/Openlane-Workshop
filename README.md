### Intro to Workshop
---
The aim of this workshop is to understand RTL to GDSII flow using Openlane.

Openlane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow and it is based on several components which include Magic, OpenROAD, YOSYS etc. The main goal of Openlane is to produce GDSII layout  without any human involvement. Openlane is tuned for Skywater 130nm open source PDK.
